    "description": "This spectacular box set comprises 11 classic martial arts films from the famous Shaw Brothers' library, featuring some of their greatest stars—Jimmy Wang Yu (One-Armed Swordsman), Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me), Lo Lieh (King Boxer), Ku Feng (The Five Venoms), and David Chiang (The Boxer From Shantung). Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! The Assassin In the same year that director/writer Chang Cheh and star Jimmy Wang Yu revolutionized Hong Kong kung fu cinema with One-Armed Swordsman, they also collaborated on this epic of the Six Kingdoms era. Here, Yu is a two-armed swordsman who is also a Wei Empire patriot. Inside the Han Empire, Han Kuei, who comes from the royal family, assumes full power and wants to eliminate loyal officer Yen Sui. Later, our main character is betrayed by a jealous rival and becomes a village butcher. But when he meets Yen Sui, he is sent back on the road of vengeance. Chiao Chiao, the lovely and talented costar of One-Armed Swordsman, here plays Hsia, the love of the hero's life and the strong woman who survives to protect their child. The Thundering Sword Superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei, (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), stars as the daughter of the Poison Master in a Romeo and Juliet-style martial arts adventure concerning a search for the magical \"Heaven and Earth\" weapon in The Thundering Sword. The Golden Swallow The indomitable martial arts team of director Chang Cheh and stunt choreographer Liu Chia-liang continues the compelling saga of The Golden Swallow from King Hu's Come Drink with Me in this sequel of heartbreaking romance, intrigue and stunning action. The Jade Raksha Thanks in great part to Cheng Pei-pei, women in martial arts movies played a more central role in the plots and the swordswomen of the genre became some of the most charismatic figures in Hong Kong cinema. In The Jade Raksha, Cheng Pei-pei becomes a human combine harvester as she hacks and whacks a path through life, avenging the death of her family under the moniker \"The Jade Raksha.\" The Bells of Death The Bells of Death is a whirlwind story about a man embarking on a life-long journey to master the sword, then find and eliminate the three men who killed his family and abducted his sister. The Sword of Swords Jimmy Wang Yu had just exploded into superstardom as One-Armed Swordsman when he teamed with respected writer/director Cheng Kang for this tale of master martial artists vying for the title blad—a \"weapon of exceptional brilliance.\" And with legendary martial arts choreographers Lau Kar-leung and Tang Chia directing the action, the result is a superb, flat-out adventure of intrigue, deception, and an abduction, delivering one battle after another until it culminates in an amazing all-out slaughter. Killer Dart Rampaging bandits are pillaging peaceful Chinese villages until the grieving dart master Liu Wen Lung sets out with his student, son, and servant to avenge his murdered wife and set things right. Renowned director Ho Meng-Hua—soon to be internationally famous for The Flying Guillotine—masterfully balances action with intrigue and romance, as the path of righteousness is littered with lies…and corpses. The Invincible Fist The Invincible Fist is one of the few films where the godfather of the kung fu film Chang Cheh headlined Lo Lieh as the leading hero three years before Lo would become the Shaw Brothers' first international star in King Boxer (aka Five Fingers of Death). Here he plays a dedicated chief constable for Tsang Chou village who falls in love with the blind daughter of a bandit who is wreaking havoc. Joining him in all the action and emotion are award-winning actor Ku Feng and future superstar David Chiang. Dragon Swamp Cheng Pei-pei, the screen's greatest swordswoman, teams with Lo Lieh for this amazing, fast-paced adventure of the \"Martial Arts World\"—where everyone is killing to gain the famous \"Jade Dragon Sword.\" Fascinating characters, like the Roaming Knight and the Master of Dragon Swamp, clash in this family feud, which takes place over twenty years. In addition to the spectacular fights, this special production holds an emotional wallop for the finale. The Flying Dagger Godfather of the kung fu film, director Chang Cheh is famous for introducing the revolutionary concept of \"yanggang\" (macho) martial arts movies. Until then, female stars (often in male swordsman roles) ruled the screens. This collaboration between him and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei-pei is exceptional indeed. Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds. The Golden Sword Lo Wei remains internationally famous for directing Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's first major movies. Cheng Pei-pei is now internationally famous for her superlative villainous role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But both were superstars in Hong Kong for decades prior, so any teaming of the superlative \"swordswoman supreme\" and the vaunted director/writer/actor is cause for celebration. Kao Yuen joins them as a noble swordsman, and award-winning actor Ku Feng stars as the Frontier Terror in the evocative and effective \"Martial Arts World\" adventure.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - The Assassin (1967):\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 2 - The Thundering Sword:\nFrom a Western Perspective: An Interview About the Transnational Appeal of The Shaw Brothers with Academic Leon Hunt, Author of \"Kung Fu Cult Masters: From Bruce Lee To Crouching Tiger\"\nInterview with Author and Critic Kim Newman About The Western \"Breakthrough\" Films of Sir Run Run Shaw, Which Took the Producer From East To West\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Golden Swallow:\nAudio Commentary by Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nInterview with Actress Cheng Pei-Pei by Frédéric Ambroisine\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Jade Raksha:\nSlicing at the Stars: An Interview with Critic and Hong Kong Film Expert Tony Rayns, About The Emergence, Key Players, and Success of The Shaw Brothers Wuxia Film\nA Very Vocal Violence: Hong Kong Based Dubber Peter Boczar Reflects on His Time Behind the Microphone for a Number Of Martial Arts Masterpieces.\nDisc 5 - The Bells of Death:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Sword of Swords:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Killer Darts:\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Invincible Fist:\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, veteran Hong Kong film critic at easternKicks\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 9 - Dragon Swamp:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 10 - The Flying Dagger:\nAudio Commentary with Frank Djeng of the New York Asian Film Festival\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Golden Sword:\nAudio Commentary with Hong Kong-Based Academic and Filmmaker Gilbert Po\nCelestial Trailer\n]]>",

    "description": "This spectacular box set comprises 12 classic martial arts films from the famous Shaw Brothers' library, featuring some of their greatest stars—Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me), Lo Lieh (King Boxer), Sammo Hung (Wheels on Meals), Ti Lung (A Better Tomorrow), and David Chiang (The Boxer from Shantung). Many of these films are debuting for the first time on Blu-ray. Get ready for some exciting thrills and chills as heroes meet villains in a duel to the death! Lady of Steel: Cheng Pei-pei was Hong Kong's first and most celebrated queen of kung fu because her performances set all the standards for future female martial arts stars like Michelle Yeoh. Lady Of Steel is a high-plains-drifter adventure where Cheng Pei-pei plays a swordswoman on a mission: to find the bandits that killed her parents and save the country from foreign invaders. Brothers Five: Years before he was to become famous for directing Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury and Jackie Chan in New Fist of Fury, Lo Wei teamed with superstar swordswoman Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me) for this action thriller of brotherly love…and death. She stars as Yen Lai, the one woman who can reunite the Kao brothers to rid the Teng Lung Manor of killers—as well as take revenge for their father's murder. The Crimson Charm: Huang Feng both writes and directs this \"Martial Arts World\" thriller of a noble swordsman and a one-armed swordswoman up against the vicious Crimson Charm gang of thieves and cutthroats. The lovely and lethal Ivy Ling Po teams with the amazing Chang I for a classic tale of good versus evil in which the best man—and one-armed woman—wins. The Shadow Whip: This top-ten box office hit reunites the star duo from Come Drink with Me in another classic action adventure. Cheng Pei-pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) radiates her trademark charm while wielding the deadly title weapon, which is implicated in multiple murders and a major heist. Whether single-handedly fighting sixteen bandits or avenging her father's brutal death, she demonstrates why she was Hong Kong's number one swordswoman—and no slouch with the whip either! The Delightful Forest Co-directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li, and written by Ni Kuang, Chang Cheh and Chin Shu-Mei, The Delightful Forest revolves around the legendary hero Wu Sung (Ti Lung), who was sent to the prison in the Meng province after murdering his sister-in-law and a local ruffian. There he was acquainted with the prison officer \"Golden Eye\" Shih En (Tien Ching), who saved Wu from the baton punishment required for new prisoners. Wu found out that Shih's restaurant, \"Delightful Forest,\" was taken by the local thug \"Door God\" Chiang Chung (Chu Mu). The Devil's Mirror: This is Sun Chung's very first film for the Shaw Brothers, making it especially interesting and important. He hit the ground running with this action-filled tale of a \"Devil Girl\" who is setting one clan against another to get her hands on two amazing mirrors with supernatural powers. Only a noble swordsman (played by Lau Dan) and beautiful swordswoman (played by The Thundering Sword star Shu Pei-pei) can stop her. Man of Iron: Chen Kuan-tai exuded incredible power on screen, which his directors used to great advantage in this fight-filled follow-up to the smash hit The Boxer from Shantung. The only thing Chou Lien Huan does wrong is win some money gambling with a Shanghai gang leader's playboy son…but that's enough for the father and child to want obsessive revenge. It all culminates in an incredible climatic fight, choreographed by the legendary Lau Kar-leung and Chan Chuen, co-star of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury. The Water Margin: The Chang Cheh-directed The Water Margin is the martial arts epic of epics…of epics. Based on the true legend of how 108 rebel heroes living in the mountains were able to repeatedly defeat invading Sung armies, the film starred just about anyone who was a name at Shaw Brothers at the time, like David Chiang, Chen Kuan-tai and Ti Lung. The primitive battles ultimately end in sharp, visually effective images of death and defeat. This is a must-see for any movie fan. The Bride from Hell: Never marry a possessed woman…especially one possessed by the spirit of a girl murdered by the uncle of the groom! That is the moral of this fascinating production, released a full two years before the international success of The Exorcist. Justice must be done and an exorcism, Hong Kong-style, must be performed before anyone can rest in peace. Talented Margaret Hsing Hui makes a fetching spirit in this mystery thriller that also incorporates a laugh or two amidst the chills. Heroes Two: Of the dozens of great martial arts movies made by this prolific and respected director, this tale of legendary Shaolin avengers Fang Shih-yu and Hung Hsi-kuan is often considered one of his best. His collaboration with equally renowned kung fu choreographer Lar Kar-leung was apparent in all the performances, but especially with that of charismatic, capable, then 19-year-old Alexander Fu Sheng. This powerful production is a true landmark in kung fu film history. The Flying Guillotine: Director Ho Meng-hua attained cult status among Western kung fu film fans with The Flying Guillotine. One of the Shaw Brothers' biggest martial arts stars, Chen Kuan-tai, plays the leader of a group of killers, commissioned by the Ching Emperor to use a deadly, beheading weapon to assassinate dissidents. Although based on a true story, the film's weapon was a complete fabrication because in real life, no one ever survived to tell what the actual weapon really looked like. The Dragon Missle: The many fans of the internationally popular Flying Guillotine films and international star Lo Lieh (King Boxer) will love this movie, featuring some of the most exciting martial arts machinery ever conceived. Everybody's fighting for a special elixir and the title tool—an ultra—cool flying boomerang with blades. There are double crosses and ambushes galore before the culminating clash of sizzling steel that must be seen to be believed.\n\nBonus Content:\nDisc 1 - Lady of Steel:\nAudio Commentary by Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 2 - Brothers Five:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic At easternKicks\nAudio Commentary by Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 3 - The Crimson Charm:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 4 - The Shadow Whip:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 5 - Delightful Forest:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with Cult Film Critic Ian Jane\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 6 - The Devil's Mirror:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nDisc 7 - Man of Iron:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary with James Mudge, Veteran Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of This Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nAn Iron Will—Meredith Lewis, Author of Ask for the Moon: Innovation at Shaw Brothers Studios, A 77-Minute Documentary on The Genesis, Rise, Peak and Fall of the Shaw Brothers Movie Empire\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 8 - The Water Margin:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary with Film Historian Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema blog)\nThe Master: Chang Cheh\nElegant Trails: Ti Lung\nElegant Trails: David Chiang\nExtended Love Scene\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nTV S pot for the U.S. release Seven Blows of the Dragon\nDisc 9 - The Bride from Hell:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nA More Traditional Terror: Hong Kong Film Historian Tony Rayns Talks Shaw Brothers Horror Films\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 10 - Heroes Two:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by David West, Critic and Author of Chasing Dragons: An Introduction to the Martial Arts Film\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nGerman Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 11 - The Flying Guillotine:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKicks\nAudio Commentary with Chris Poggiali, Co-Author of These Fists Break Bricks and Brian Bankston (Cool Ass Cinema Blog)\nFlying Without Wings: Actor Kai Kang Shares His Memories of Working with the Studio in His First Ever On-Camera Interview\nDubbing Delirium: Joseph Ellison, Dubbing Artist on Flying Guillotine for Its U.S. Release, Reflects on the Early Kung-Fu Film Boom\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nCelestial Trailer\nDisc 12 - The Dragon Missle:\nAudio: Mandarin Mono DTS-HD Master Audio with New Subtitle Translation, English Dub Mono DTS-HD Master Audio\nAudio Commentary by James Mudge, Hong Kong Film Critic at easternKic ks\nCutting Comments: Jim Marcovic, Editor of Many Martial Arts Trailers for U.S. Cinemas During The 70s and 80s, Speaks About the Kung Fu Film Boom\nTrailers For Shaw Brothers Classics Volume 1 and the Brave Archer Collection (The Jade Raksha, Little Dragon Maiden, Killer Darts, The Flying Dagger, Dragon Swamp, The Brave Archer and His Mate, The Bells of Death, The Sword of Swords, The Invincible Fist\n]]>",
