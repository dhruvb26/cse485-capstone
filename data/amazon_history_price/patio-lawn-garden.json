The C-anchor stake is a purpose-built plastic anchor stake that has a loop which secures both 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing with barbs on the stake itself that anchor it firmly in the soil. The loop anchor stakes/staples come in 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch versions and are very similar to traditional landscape fabric stakes. They work best for firmer soils which provide some grip on the wire. While the C-anchor stake provides a more secure hold in a wider variety of soils, the wire loop anchor stakes provide the dual benefit of holding drip tubing and landscape fabric in place. Each of the anchor stakes is reusable and provides years of reliable service. Drip tubing straps (sold separately) are an excellent way to anchor 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch tubing to walls, railings, and other surfaces.",

This layer increases the panel's energy generation by boosting efficiency.\nHalf-Cell architecture improves shade tolerance, ensuring better electrical performance over conventional modules.\nCompared with a standard 5-Busbar design, the 10-Busbar design reduces the impact of microcracks and minimizes the cell gap to ensure performance and increase the module's efficiency.\nHigher Efficiency\n- Renogy's 550W monocrystalline solar panel provides an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (Wh) power per day (depending on sun availability).\n- It has passed the strict electroluminescence (EL) test without any microcracks. No hot spots.\nMore Power, Less Space\n- Engineered with industry-leading technologies, this high-powered 550W solar panel provides maximum power generation for your limited roof space.\n- It's an economical long-term investment for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, residential and commercial applications.\nCorrosion-Resistant Aluminum Frame\n- Corrosion-resistant aluminum frame design ensures the solar panel survives in harsh outdoor environments, including the burning sun and heavy rain.\n- Provides an extended period of work time without damage or loss of performance.\nPre-Drilled Holes for Easy Installation\n- Renogy solar panels are equipped with back frame and ground mounting holes, ready for installation.\n- They are easy to mount and secure, ideal for off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid solar systems.\nExtreme Weather Endurance\n- Withstand up to 5400 Pa of heavy snow load and up to 2400 Pa of high wind.\n- Provide excellent durability in a harsh environment.\nExtended Durability\n- IP68 rated waterproof junction box and solar connectors ensure that water and dust will not enter during extended outdoor use.\n- The built-in bypass diodes protect the solar cells from overheating, allowing the solar panel to perform during accidental shading by bypassing the underperforming cells.\n550W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 50in Tilt Mount Brackets 320W Monocrystalline Solar Panel 450W Bifacial Solar Panels 550W Bifacial Solar Panels 800W 12V Monocrystalline Solar Kit\nMaximum Power 550 Watt 50 inch 320 Watt Bifacial 450 Watt Bifacial 550 Watt 800 Watt\nItem Dimensions 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 in 50 x 1.97 x 0.98 in 65.6 x 39.4 x 1.4 in 75.2 x44.6 x 1.4 in 91.73 x 47.24 x 1.4 in 41.8 x 20.9 x 11.2 in\nItem Weight 62.8 lbs 7.20 lbs 39.7 lbs 50.9 lbs 67.85 lbs 125.3 lbs\nFAQ\n1.Q:Is each panel 550 Watt or a whole combination? What about the size and weight?\nA:550 Watt per panel. The dimension of one panel is 89.7 x 44.6 x 1.4 inches, and the weight is 62.8 lbs.\n2.Q:How many kWh a day does this solar panel produce?\nA:If your solar panels are exposed to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day, it can provide an average of 2200-2750 Watt-hours (2.2 kWh - 2.75 kWh) of electricity (depending on sun availability).\n3.Q:Why choose this high-powered 550 Watt module rather than 5-6 100 Watt solar panels?\nA:High-powered solar panels are primarily used for utility-scale systems, solar power plants, solar farms, residential and commercial applications. Compared with 100 Watt solar panels, these high-powered 550 Watt modules provide maximum power generation for your limited roof space. They also allow the use of fewer mounting systems, including wiring cables, screws, or mounting brackets.\n4.Q:Can these panels be used on a grid-tied system?\nA:Sure, they can. These high-powered 550 Watt solar panels work with on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid systems. But please note that when using them on on-grid and hybrid systems, we recommend that you contact a licensed solar installer familiar with on-grid/hybrid setups.On-Grid solar system means solar power equipment (array or solar panel) is connected to the utility grid.Off-Grid solar system refers to a system that is not connected to the grid.An Off-Grid system is not affected by grid blackouts. A Hybrid system is when your solar panels remain connected to the grid's power lines and have a backup battery system to store excess power.\n5.Q:How should I connect solar panels to my electrical circuit (series vs parallel)?\nA:Solar panels can be connected in series or in parallel to meet your electrical circuit size and power needs.Connecting solar panels in series, the operating voltage output will add up while the current output will remain the same as a single solar panel.When connecting solar panels in parallel, the operating current output will add up while the voltage output will remain the same as a single solar panel.To meet your power system's optimum power output and system rating, you can use parallel and series connections. Please note that we recommend connecting the solar panels with the same open circuit voltage.\n6.Q:Do these panels have pre-drilled holes on the back?\nA:Yes, they have. The pre-drilled holes help you to install the solar panel quickly and securely.\n7.Q:Can this solar panel be adapted to a 12V Marine Battery or 48V Lithium Battery?\nA:Yes, it can. The optimum operating voltage of this 550W solar panel is 41.97V. So it's suitable to use for charging your 12V Marine Battery and 48V Lithium Battery (by connecting at least two solar panels in series). Please note that you need to connect the solar panel(s) to a Charge Controller supporting a 12V or 48V system.",
    "features": "【High-Powered Module】 This solar panel is engineered with high-efficiency PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact) cells, capturing more light to achieve 22.8% conversion efficiency. Resulting in higher performance than most conventional panels, Renogy's 550 watt panels provide more output per surface area.\n【High Tolerance】 Renogy's high-powered 550 watt solar panels are made with half-cell technology. This half-cut panel is more tolerant of shading on any part of the cell and performs excellently in low light situations due to the increased number of cells receiving more sunlight.\n【Optimized Space and Installation】 A great option for large-scale installations, each solar panel can produce up to 2750 Wh of electricity per day and requires fewer installations per panel on your rooftop.\n【Reliable and Durable】 Corrosion-resistant aluminum frame provides extended outdoor use that ensures the panel can last for decades. The IP68 rated junction box and solar connectors can withstand dirt, dust, debris, and water splashes.\n【Claim Federal Solar Tax Credit】 Claim up to 30% of your home's new solar system costs (both equipment and installation) for a tax credit.
