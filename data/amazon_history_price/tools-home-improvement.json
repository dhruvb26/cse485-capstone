Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button. A once mundane trip to the bathroom can become a spa-like experience with the addition of a WASHLET. The TOTO WASHLET K300 features instantaneous water heating with five spray settings for front and rear washing, including an optional oscillating or pulsating stream. Equipped with a comfortable heated seat, warm air dryer, and a deodorizer to neutralize odors and enhance your overall experience. The illuminated remote control can be handheld or mounted to the wall for convenient use. The K300 prevents toilet bowl waste buildup by using TOTO's advanced PREMIST technology that sprays the bowl before every use to keep it clean. The new K300 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, thus conserving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet. With a WASHLET, just the touch of a button can leave you feeling clean and refreshed. Easy to install and includes mounting and connection hardware.",

    "description": "Product Description\nThe Kidde Carbon Monoxide Detector, Propane, Natural, & Explosive Gas Alarm, Plug-In Wall with 9-Volt Battery Backup, Digital LED Display uses electrochemical sensor technology to detect poisonous carbon monoxide, methane gas, sewer gas, propane gas or natural gas in your home and alerts you by sounding an 85-decibel alarm & displaying the amount of carbon monoxide detected or stating \"gas\" on the digital display when detecting explosive gas. Setup is easy as the Kidde carbon monoxide alarm plugs into a standard, 120V AC power outlet in your home, while a 9-volt alkaline battery (included) works as a backup in the event of a power failure. When carbon monoxide is detected, the digital display shows the level of carbon monoxide the alarm is sensing and updates every 15 seconds. Peak Level Memory records the last time carbon monoxide was detected or when the unit was tested. The Smart-Hush button silences the unit for approximately 8 minutes, which is helpful when this smoke detector carbon monoxide detector combo sounds from things like routine cooking or shower steam. Extension cord (included) allows for placement on a table or shelf. Install a carbon monoxide smoke detector combo on every level of your home and near bedrooms to help keep your family safe.

The Nighthawk is an easy-to-install unit that provides reliable protection against the dangers of CO and explosive gas. The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.\nAdvanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design\nDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.\nThe Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane Exposure\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.\nLikewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.\nAudible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels\nWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.\nEasy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.\nLED Shows Sensor Status\nWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.\nConvenient Mounting Options\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.\nThe UL-listed Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\nAbout Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand\nRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.

Designed by plumbing and tech industry professionals, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff is installed on the main water supply line of the home. Through the Moen Smart Water App you can see live water use, including water flow rates, pressure and even temperature. If the Smart Water Shutoff detects an issue (e.g. high pressure, freezing water, or a small leak) it will alert you through the App, or other preferred notification methods, so you can assess the issue before it causes costly damage. If there is a catastrophic failure, like a burst pipe or someone leaves the water running, you will be alerted in the App allowing you to shut the water off remotely—no matter where you are. If you fail to respond to the alert or are on vacation, the device can be set to automatically shut off water to help limit damage and loss.",
