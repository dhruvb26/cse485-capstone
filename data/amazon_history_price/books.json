    "description": "From the Publisher\nBringing together all the greatsâ€”from Air Jordan 1 to Air Prestoâ€”Nike and Virgil Abloh reinvent sneaker culture with the collaborative project The Ten and redesign 10 sneaker icons. Experience engineering ingenuity and Ablohâ€™s investigative design process: each shoe is a piece of industrial design, a readymade sculpture, and a wearable all at once.\nVirgil Abloh (1980â€“2021) was a multi-hyphenate creative that often rejected classification on creativity. He operated in the realms of Art, Design, and Culture in conjunction with advocacy, mentoring, and philanthropy in the spaces he occupied. After earning a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he completed a masterâ€™s degree in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago. At IIT, while studying a Bauhaus design curriculum devised by Mies van der Rohe, Abloh began to craft the principles of his broader art practice. The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago presented a major traveling survey of Ablohâ€™s work in summer 2019â€”one of the highest attended exhibitions in the museumâ€™s history. Abloh was the Chief Creative Director and founder of Off-White and from 2018 to 2021 Menâ€™s Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton, amongst other endeavors.\nThe Sneaker as (Hyper)Object\nIn 2016, sportswear manufacturer Nike and fashion designer Virgil Abloh joined forces to create a sneaker collection celebrating 10 of the Oregon-based companyâ€™s most iconic shoes. With their project The Tenâ€”which reimagines icons like Air Jordan 1, Air Max 90, Air Force 1, and Air Presto, among othersâ€”they reinvigorated sneaker culture.\nVirgil Ablohâ€™s new designs offer deep insights into engineering ingenuity and burst with cultural cachet. Drawing on the genius of the original shoe using lettering, ironic labels, collage, and sculpting techniques, Abloh plays with language and sculptural elements to construct new meaning. Inspired by the wit of Dadaism, architectural theory, and avant-garde happenings, he analyzes what makes each shoe iconic and deconstructs it into an artistic assemblage, making each shoe into a piece of industrial design, a readymade sculpture, and a wearable all at once.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nIcons traces Ablohâ€™s investigative, creative process through documentation of the prototypes, original text messages from Abloh to Nike designers, and treasures from the Nike archives.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe find Swooshes sliced away from Air Jordans and reapplied with tape or thread, Ablohâ€™s typical text fragments in quotation marks on Air Force 1, and All Stars cut into pieces.\nCopyright: Virgil Abloh/Nike\nWe take a look behind the scenes and witness Ablohâ€™s DIY approach, which gives each model in the collection its own unique touch.\nThe book documents Ablohâ€™s cooperative way of working and reaffirms the power of print. For its design Nike and Abloh partnered with the acclaimed London-based design studio Zak Group. Together they conceived a two-part compendium, equal parts catalog and conceptual toolbox. The first part of the book presents a visual culture of sneakers while a lexicon in the second part defines the key people, places, objects, ideas, materials, and scenes from which the project grew. Texts by Nikeâ€™s Nicholas Schonberger, writer Troy Patterson, curator and historian Glenn Adamson, and Virgil Abloh himself frame the collaborative work within fashion and design history. A foreword by Hiroshi Fujiwara places the project within the historical continuum of Nike collaborators.",
