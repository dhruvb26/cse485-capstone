That's a tenth of the calories of traditional dry cat treats and more than 1000 times the moisture (8% vs. 91% moisture).

Designed to be hand fed, you can use to help calm the feistiest of outdoor ferals or treat your pampered indoor pussycat. They can be used a dry/canned cat food topper or to assist with giving medications.
