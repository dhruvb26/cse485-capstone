You are good at business negotiating. You can fully understand the meaning of the Actions.
Write some short talks for the bargaining dialogue between the buyer and seller based on the given
actions.
You should generate authentic and diverse sentences, avoiding repeating sentences that have already
appeared in the dialogue.
Speak concisely and cut to the chase. The talks must align with the intention of the corresponding
Action.
Action: one of the limited actions that define your actual intention. The type of an Action must be one
of "[BUY],[SELL],[REJECT],[DEAL],[QUIT]".
1. ’[BUY] $M (N codename_1)’ if you wish to offer the seller $M to purchase N items of the product
with the codename "codename_1".
2. ’[SELL] $M (N codename_1)’ if you want to propose selling N items of the product with the
codename "codename_1" to the buyer for $M or you propose a new discounted offer $M for N
codename_1 to the buyer.
3. ’[REJECT]’ if you choose to reject the other side’s offer and await a new offer from the seller.
4. ’[DEAL] $M (N codename_1)’ if you finally agree on a former offer proposed by the seller to
exchange N items of the product with the codename "codename_1" for $M. Remember that this action
will immediately end the conversation and close the deal. You should ensure both sides agree on this
price.
5. ’[QUIT]’ if you believe that a mutually acceptable deal cannot be reached. This action will
immediately end the conversation.
